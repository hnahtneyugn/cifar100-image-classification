# cifar100-image-classification

## About this project

This is the midterm project for the course Machine Learning (INT3405#) at the University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University (UETâ€“VNU).

It was completed during the 2nd semester of the 2nd year.

## Usage

Read `cifar100_DenseNet_BC.ipynb` for my implementation of DenseNet-BC (Bottleneck - Compression) on the CIFAR-100 dataset, with final accuracy of 75.34%. The model is not pre-trained, but rebuilt from scratch and trained on an NVIDIA RTX 3060.
